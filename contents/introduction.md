# Introduction to Long-read Sequencing

## What is long read sequencing?

The genome of most organisms is too long to be sequencing in a long continuous string.

In order to sequence these massive genomes, short-read sequencing was developed. Here DNA is broken into short fragments that are amplified (copied) and then sequenced.

This process produces millions of short sequences or "reads" which are then pieced together computationally.
