# 5. Variant calling

In this section we will cover:

* [SNVcalling](#snvcalling)
* [SVcalling](#svcalling)

You will learn to:

- Call SNVs from nanopore data and compare them to short-read sequencing SNVs
- Call SVs and interpret the results

## SNVcalling

Variants are called and stored in [VCF](http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf) format. This contains a header, and then data lines each containing information about a position in the genome.

In this section we will identify SNVs from long-read sequencing data using [Longshot](https://github.com/pjedge/longshot).

Go to your wd:

```
cd ~/Course_Materials/nanopore_practical/wd
```

And call SNVs in the nanopore aligment example as below:

```
longshot --bam ../../data/day2/alignment/long_reads.bam --ref ../../data/day2/reference_genome/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.fasta --out long_reads-SNVs.vcf
```

Compress and index the VCF file:


```
bgzip long_reads-SNVs.vcf
tabix -p vcf long_reads-SNVs.vcf.gz
```

Now you can compare the instersection between both using bcftools:

```
bcftools isec -p isec long_reads-SNVs.vcf.gz ../../data/day2/variant_calling/short_reads-SNVs.vcf.gz
```

This will creat a folder named isec with the following files:

* isec/0000.vcf   for records private to the long_reads_VCF
* isec/0001.vcf   for records private to the short_reads_VCF
* isec/0002.vcf   for records from long_reads_VCF shared by both
* isec/0003.vcf   for records from short_reads_VCF shared by both

- How many SNVs have been called by both technologies?
- How many SNVs have been missed by short and/or long read sequencing?

## SVcalling

Algorithms for calling SVs from long-read sequencing data include:
-	[Sniffles](http://github.com/fritzsedlazeck/Sniffles): best used with minimap2 or NGMLR. 
-	[NanoSV](http://github.com/philres/ngmlr): best used with LAST.

Since we used minimap2 for the alignment, now we will use sniffles for calling structural variants.

```
sniffles -m ~/Course_Materials/nanopore_practical/data/day2/alignment/long_reads.bam -v variant_calling/long_reads_SVs.vcf
```

If you want to look at high quality SVs, you can change the -s parameter to 20, where s is the minimum number of reads that support a SV (by default is 10).

```
sniffles -m ~/Course_Materials/nanopore_practical/data/day2/alignment/long_reads.bam -v variant_calling/long_reads_SVs_s20.vcf -s 20
```

The information that is provided in snifflesâ€™s output can be found in:
[http://github.com/fritzsedlazeck/Sniffles/wiki/Output](http://github.com/fritzsedlazeck/Sniffles/wiki/Output)

To know how many SVs have been called, we will run:

```
bcftools view -H variant_calling/long_reads_SVs.vcf | wc -l
```

To annotate the VCF, 

.....

You can also convert the VCF to a tab format:

```
../scripts/vcf2tab.py variant_calling/long_reads_SVs.vcf
```

and inspect the deletions in IGV.

-	How many deletions are real?
-	How many SVs breakpoint junctions are within repetitive sequences?
     - For that, you would need to load Repeatmasker from server (File > Load from server > Annotations > Variation and Repeats > Repeat Masker)

## Analysis report

The tutorial document can also be prepared from the Linux command line with the following command.

```
R --slave -e 'rmarkdown::render("ont_tutorial_sv.Rmd", "html_document")'
```
