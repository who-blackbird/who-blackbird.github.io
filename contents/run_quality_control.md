## The run completed successfully - so now what?

### In this section we will cover:

1. Signal to sequence workflow
2. Run directory structure
3. Raw "fast5" data
4. Basecalling
5. Fastq

#### You will learn to:

7. Take a run summary file and extract QC data
8. Interpret this data

## 1. Singal to sequence workflow

The below image represents the process of translating raw electrical signal data from an ON sequencer to DNA sequence.

We are going to learn how to do this!!

But... before we get too technical, lets take a look at how Nanopore's machines write data!

## 2. Run directory structure

All nanopore data is written to a specific run directory. Open up a terminal and change to the example directory belowâ€¦

```
cd ~/Desktop/quality_control/example_runs/example_1_20191202_PAE13924
```

... and check it out using tree!

```
tree .
```

_note: **.** is a shortcut for the current directory you are in_
_note2: at home mac users might need to install the tree command!_

#########################################

This process is called **basecalling**.

Basecalling is a critical step in the analysis workflow as poor basecalling makes poor sequence data.

#### Before we proceed...

As this is a 'introduction' course, we recommened that you enable 'on board' or 'real time' basecalling. In laymans terms, this means letting nanopores software automatically base call for you.

Infact, this is what we use as a group.
